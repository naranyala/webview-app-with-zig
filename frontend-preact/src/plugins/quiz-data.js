        question:
          'Which shortcut frames the selected object in the 3D Viewport?',
        answer:
          'Press Numpad . (the decimal key). On compact keyboards, use View > Frame Selected or enable Emulate Numpad.',
        explanation:
          'Framing the selection is useful when a scene becomes crowded or an object is outside the current view.',

        id: 'blender-object-edit',
        question: 'What is the difference between Object Mode and Edit Mode?',
        answer:
          "Object Mode transforms whole objects and manages scene-level relationships. Edit Mode changes the selected object's mesh, curves, or other editable data.",
        explanation:
          'A transform in Object Mode does not directly edit mesh vertices. This separation makes non-destructive scene layout possible.',

        difficulty: 'Starter'

      {
        id: 'blender-modifier',
        question: 'Why would you use a Subdivision Surface modifier?',
        answer:
          'It smooths and subdivides a mesh procedurally, adding resolution while preserving the lower-resolution control cage.',
        explanation:
          'Keeping the modifier unapplied lets you continue editing the simpler base mesh and change the subdivision level later.',

        id: 'blender-normals',
        question: 'What do mesh normals describe?',
        answer:
          'Normals describe the direction a face is considered to be pointing. They affect shading, backface behavior, and some geometry operations.',
        explanation:
          'If faces appear dark or render inside out, inspect normals and use Mesh > Normals > Recalculate Outside when appropriate.',

        id: 'blender-collection',
        question: 'What is a Collection used for in Blender?',
        answer:
          'A Collection groups objects in the Outliner so they can be organized, selected, hidden, or instanced together.',
        explanation:
          'Collections are scene organization tools, not mesh data containers. One object can be linked into multiple collections.',

        difficulty: 'Starter'

      {
        id: 'blender-shader',
        question: 'In the Principled BSDF shader, what does Roughness control?',
        answer:
          'Roughness controls how broadly light scatters across a surface. Low values look sharper and glossier; high values look softer and more matte.',
        explanation:
          'Roughness is a perceptual material control, while metallic determines whether the surface behaves like a conductor or a dielectric.',
        tags: ['materials', 'rendering'],
        difficulty: 'Intermediate'
      },
      {
        id: 'blender-origin',
        question: "Why does an object's origin matter?",
        answer:
          "The origin is the object's transformation pivot. Its position and orientation affect rotation, scaling, parenting, and modifier behavior.",
        explanation:
          'Setting the origin deliberately prevents surprising rotations and makes repeated transforms easier to control.',
        tags: ['transforms', 'workflow'],
        difficulty: 'Starter'
      },
      {
        id: 'blender-render-engine',
        question: 'When might you choose Eevee over Cycles?',
        answer:
          'Choose Eevee when interactive speed and fast previews matter. Choose Cycles when physically based path-traced lighting and higher final accuracy matter.',
        explanation:
          'The best choice depends on the target: iteration speed, stylized rendering, and real-time output favor Eevee, while realism often favors Cycles.',

        id: 'audio-sample-rate',
        question: 'What does a digital audio sample rate describe?',
        answer:
          'It is the number of amplitude measurements taken per second, measured in hertz. A 48 kHz stream has 48,000 samples per second.',
        explanation:
          'By the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, the sample rate must be more than twice the highest frequency you want to represent.',

      },
      {
        id: 'audio-aliasing',
        question: 'What is aliasing in digital audio?',
        answer:
          'Aliasing is unwanted frequency content created when a signal contains frequencies above the Nyquist limit and is sampled without adequate filtering.',
        explanation:
          'An anti-aliasing low-pass filter before conversion, plus oversampling where useful, helps keep those mirrored frequencies out of the audible result.',

      },
      {
        id: 'audio-buffer',
        question: 'What is the tradeoff when choosing an audio buffer size?',
        answer:
          'Smaller buffers reduce latency but leave less time for processing and increase the risk of underruns. Larger buffers are safer but feel less responsive.',
        explanation:
          'Real-time audio code must finish each buffer before the hardware needs it; missing that deadline produces clicks or dropouts.',

        id: 'audio-oscillator',
        question: 'How can an oscillator generate a sine wave?',
        answer:
          'Maintain a phase value, advance it by frequency divided by sample rate for each sample, and evaluate sin(2π × phase). Wrap phase when it reaches one.',
        explanation:
          'A phase accumulator generalizes well to wavetable oscillators and keeps pitch stable across a block of samples.',

        difficulty: 'Intermediate'
      },
      {
        id: 'audio-filter',
        question: 'What does a low-pass filter do?',
        answer:
          'It attenuates frequencies above its cutoff while allowing lower frequencies to pass, with the exact transition shaped by its filter design and slope.',
        explanation:
          'Low-pass filters are used for tone shaping, anti-aliasing, smoothing control signals, and reducing high-frequency noise.',

      },
      {
        id: 'audio-decibels',
        question: 'Why are decibels useful for audio gain?',
        answer:
          'Decibels express ratios logarithmically, matching the way loudness and signal levels are commonly perceived. For amplitude, gain is 20 log10(linear ratio).',
        explanation:
          'A gain of 0 dB means unity amplitude; positive and negative dB values represent boosts and cuts relative to that reference.',

        question:
          'Why should real-time audio callbacks avoid blocking and allocation?',
        answer:
          'The callback has a strict deadline. Locks, file I/O, unpredictable allocation, or heavy logging can pause it long enough to cause an audible glitch.',
        explanation:
          'Pass prepared data through lock-free or bounded structures and do slow work on another thread before the callback needs it.',

        answer:
          'It converts a time-domain block into frequency-domain bins, showing the strength and phase of frequency components represented in that block.',
        explanation:
          'FFT resolution depends on both sample rate and block length. Windowing reduces spectral leakage but changes the measurement tradeoffs.',
